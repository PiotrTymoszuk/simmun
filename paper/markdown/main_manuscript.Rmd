## Ethics statement

The SIMMUN study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and European Data Policy. 
All participants gave written informed consent prior to enrollment. 
Participants' data were stored and analyzed in anonymized form.
This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University Innsbruck, Austria (approval number: 1132/2020). 
No approval by the ethics committee was required for analysis of the published anonymized INCOV data set [@Su2022].

## Study cohorts

### SIMMUN study

Individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR at the University Hospital of Innsbruck Medical University (Innsbruck, Austria) and patients of the University Clinic for Psychiatry I and II (Innsbruck, Austria) undergoing routine SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening were invited to participate in the SIMMUN study. 
The study enrollment was conducted between 10. June 2020 (first patient enrolled) and 27.May 2021 (last study visit). 
The inclusion criteria were age of 18 - 70 years, proficiency in German language, residence in the study region (Tyrol, Austria), results of a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test conducted at the University Hospital of Innsbruck. 
The exclusion criteria were active SARS-CoV-2 infection (< 14 days following a positive test), pregnancy, active malignancies, organ transplantation, prior surgery in the past 3 months, or acute or chronic inflammatory illness and treatment with oral corticosteroids. 
The analysis inclusion criterion was the complete study variable dataset (__Supplementary Table S1__). 
A total of `r nrow(stigma$analysis_tbl)` SIMMUN study participants were included in the analysis (__Figure \@ref(fig:fig-inclusion)__, __Table \@ref(tab:tab-stigma-cohort)__). 
Significant differences between the analyzed participants and participants excluded due to data missingness are listed in __Supplementary Table S2__.

### INCOV study

Proteome and metabolome data and clinical information for the INCOV cohort were extracted from supplementary tables accompanying the report by Su and colleagues [@Su2022]. 
In the current analysis, `r nrow(incov$analysis_tbl)` INCOV study participants with the complete age information and dataset of metabolites related to serotonin and dopamine turnover and major inflammatory cytokines were included (__Figure 1__, __Table \@ref(tab:tab-incov-cohort)__, __Supplementary Table S3__).

## Procedures

Details on study procedures are provided in __Supplementary Methods__. 

### SIMMUN study

The SIMMUN study variables with their transformation and stratification schemes are listed in __Supplementary Table S\@ref(tab:tab-study-vars)__.
The SIMMUN study data were gathered during in-person visits including a physician assessment, supervised completion of self-rating questionnaire and a blood sample collection. 

Demographic and clinical history variables: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), professionally diagnosed mental illness, self-reported chronic somatic conditions, smoking and alcohol consumption history, result and date of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were surveyed during the study visit or extracted from electronic patient records. 

Inflammatory markers: plasma neopterin concentrations (NEO) and neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were determined by the certified clinical routine laboratory at the University Hospital of Innsbruck. 
Plasma concentrations of tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), phenylalanine (PHE) and tyrosine (TYR) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the KYN/TRP and PHE/TYR ratios calculated [@Capuron2011; @Widner1997; @Neurauter2008]. 
Plasma titer of immunoglobulin gamma against receptor binding domain S1/S2 protein (anti-RBD IgG) were quantified by ELISA as described before [@Deisenhammer2021]. 
Laboratory measurements at and beyond the detection limits were substituted with the lower or upper detection limit value, respectively. 

Mental stress was scored with the 4-item perceived stress scale (PSS-4) [@Cohen1983]. 
Anxiety and depression signs were scored with the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) including 7 items for anxiety and 7 items for depression [@Zigmond1983]. 
The total possible score range for each subscale is 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more intense symptoms of anxiety/depression. 
Clinically relevant signs of anxiety or depression were identified with the cutoff of $\geq$ 8 points [@Bjelland2002; @Zigmond1983].

In order to improve normality of some numeric study variables prior to linear modeling and statistical hypothesis testing with parametric tools, logarithm or square root transformations were applied (__Supplementary Table S1__)

### INCOV cohort

Plasma proteomes and metabolomes in the INCOV cohort were measured by proximity extension assay (Olink, Sweden) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem accurate mass spectrometry (Metabolon, USA) [@Su2022; @Su2020]. 
The proteome, metabolome data in form of normalized, age- and sex-adjusted, log~2~-transformed plasma concentrations as well as clinical information were extracted from [supplementary tables](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/96v329bg7g/1) of the report by Su et al. [@Su2022]. 
In the current report plasma levels of metabolites implicated in biosynthesis and turnover, and competitor pathway products for serotonin (serotonin [5-HT], TRP, KYN, quinolinate [QUIN]) and dopamine (PHE, TYR and dopamine 3-O-sulfate [DA sulfate]), as well as major inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL6], interleukin-10 [IL10], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF] and interferon-gamma [IFNG]) were analyzed (__Supplementary Table S3__).

Plasma metabolites and proteome were measured in uninfected controls and SARS-CoV-2 individuals at three timepoints after diagnosis: 
acute (median: `r (blast(incov$analysis_tbl, timepoint) %>% map_dbl(~median(.x$time_po)) %>% signif(2))['acute']` days), 
sub-acute (median: `r (blast(incov$analysis_tbl, timepoint) %>% map_dbl(~median(.x$time_po)) %>% signif(2))['sub-acute']`) and 
recovery (median: `r (blast(incov$analysis_tbl, timepoint) %>% map_dbl(~median(.x$time_po)) %>% signif(2))['recovery']` after diagnosis) (__Supplementary Table S3__). 

## Study endpoints

The primary analysis endpoint was to determine demographic, clinical, psychometric, inflammation- and SARS-CoV-2-related factors influencing plasma levels of serotonin and dopamine precursors and products of competitor metabolic pathways (TRP, KYN, KYN/TRP, PHE, TYR, PHE/TYR) in a real world collective of medical service users during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics. 
This endpoint was addressed by multi-parameter modeling and univariable statistical hypothesis testing in the SIMMUN cohort. 
The secondary analysis endpoint was to investigate how the readouts of systemic serotonin and dopamine availability, plasma 5-HT and DA sulfate, are influenced by age, inflammatory cytokines, timepoint of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and serum levels of their precursors (TRP, PHE, TYR) and competitor pathway products (KYN, QUIN). 
This endpoint was addressed by multi-parameter robust linear modeling, univariate time course modeling and correlation analysis in the INCOV cohort (__Figure \@ref(fig:fig-inclusion)__).

## Statistical analysis

Details of data transformation and analysis are provided in __Supplementary Methods__. 

R version 4.2.3 was used for statistical analysis. 

Numeric variables were presented in the text and tables as medians with interquartile ranges and ranges. 
Categorical variables are presented as percentages and counts within the complete observation set. 
Distribution normality and variance homogeneity was assessed by Shapiro-Wilk and Levene test, respectively. 
In the SIMMUN cohort, non-normally distributed numeric variables were transformed with the logarithm or square root functions prior to modeling and analyses with parametric tests (__Supplementary Table S1__). 
Since most of the INCOV study variables were non-normally distributed, robust linear modeling and non-parametric testing were employed in the analysis of those data. 
Uniformity and consistency of psychometric tools was investigated by factor analysis and global McDonald's $\omega$ statistic [@McDonald1999; @Bartlett1937; @Revelle2022]. 
Except for results of multi-parameter modeling, p values were corrected for multiple testing with the false discovery rate method [@Benjamini1995] separately for each analysis task. 
Effects with p < 0.05 were considered significant.

Correlation was assessed by Spearman's rank or Pearson test. 
Significance of comparisons of numeric variables between two groups was determined by Mann-Whitney test with r effect size statistic or by two-tailed T test with Cohen's d effect size metric. 
Comparisons of categorical variable distributions were evaluated by $\chi^2$ test with Cramer V effect size statistic. 
Correlation was assessed by Pearson's or Spearman's rank test [@Cohen2013; @Kassambara2021]. 

In the SIMMUN cohort, effects of age, sex, body mass class, somatic and metal conditions, body mass class, smoking and alcohol consumption history, the inflammation markers NEO and NLR, SARS-CoV-2 infection status, anti-RBD IgG titer, signs of depression and anxiety (HADS), mental stress scoring (PSS-4) on systemic levels of aminoacid neurotransmitter precursor and competitor pathway products (TRP, KYN, KYN/TRP ratio, PHE, TYR and PHE/TYR ratio) was assessed by multi-parameter linear regression with backward elimination. 
Modeling responses and explanatory variables were subjected to normality-stabilizing transformations (__Supplementary Table S1__) and normalized prior to modeling in the SIMMUN cohort. 
The normality and homogeneity of linear model residuals were evaluated by Shapiro-Wilk and Levene test, respectively, and visual inspection (residuals versus fitted and quantile-quantile plots). 
In the INCOV cohort, effects of age, plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL10, TNF, IFNG), timepoint of SARS-CoV-2 infection (acute, sub-acute, recovery versus uninfected control) and plasma levels of neurotransmitter precursors and competitor pathway products (TRP, KYN, QUIN, PHE, TYR) on plasma levels of 5-HT and DA sulfate were modeled by multi-parameter robust linear regression with the MM algorithm and Huber psi function [@Huber2011; @Ripley2022]. 
Reproducibility and proper parameterization of the the linear and robust multi-parameter models was investigated by comparison of the RMSE and $R^2$ statistics in with the training dataset and in 10-fold cross-validation [@Kuhn2008]. 
Significance of the model estimates was assessed by two-tailed T test. 

Differences in normalized blood concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and metabolites between uninfected controls, acute and sub-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery in the INCOV collective were investigated with robust linear modeling (MM algorithm, Huber's psi function) with uninfected subset serving as baseline. 

Pairwise Spearman's correlation coefficients $\rho$ were calculated for plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and metabolites in the INCOV cohort. 
The correlation matrices were subsequently scaled into the [0, 1] range and converted to undirected force directed graphs [@Csardi2006]. 
The graphs were visualized as two-dimensional network plots with the node proximity determined by the $\rho$ value and random repulsion, and edge color and width coding for the $\rho$ value and sign [@Briatte2021].
