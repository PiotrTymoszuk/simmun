abstract = {Increasing evidence supports the notion that neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), at least in a subset of patients. By virtue of their capacity to transform into reactive states in response to inflammatory insults, microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, play a pivotal role in the induction of neuroinflammation. Experimental studies have demonstrated the ability of microglia to recognize pathogens or damaged cells, leading to the activation of a cytotoxic response that exacerbates damage to brain cells. However, microglia display a wide range of responses to injury and may also promote resolution stages of inflammation and tissue regeneration. MDD has been associated with chronic priming of microglia. Recent studies suggest that altered microglial morphology and function, caused either by intense inflammatory activation or by senescence, may contribute to depression and associated impairments in neuroplasticity. In this context, modifying microglia phenotype by tuning inflammatory pathways might have important translational relevance to harness neuroinflammation in MDD. Interestingly, it was recently shown that different microglial phenotypes are associated with distinct metabolic pathways and analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms points to an instrumental role for energy metabolism in shaping microglial functions. Here, we review various canonical pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and metabolic pathways in microglia that may provide new therapeutic opportunities to control neuroinflammation in brain disorders, with a strong focus on MDD.},

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in long-term psychiatric symptoms because of the immunologic response to the virus itself as well as fundamental life changes related to the pandemic. This immune response leads to altered tryptophan (TRP)–kynurenine (KYN) pathway (TKP) metabolism, which plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of mental illnesses. We aimed to define TKP changes as a potential underlying mechanism of psychiatric disorders in post-COVID-19 patients. We measured plasma levels of several TKP markers, including KYN, TRP, kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and quinolinic acid (QUIN), as well as the TRP/KYN, KYNA/3-HK, and KYNA/QUIN ratios, in 90 post-COVID-19 patients (on the first day of hospitalization) and 59 healthy controls (on the first admission to the Check-Up Center). An online questionnaire that included the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used 6 months after the initial assessment in both groups. A total of 32.2% of participants with COVID-19 showed depressive symptoms, 21.1% exhibited anxiety, and 33.3% had signs of stress at follow-up, while 6.6% of healthy controls exhibited depressive and anxiety symptoms and 18.6% had signs of stress. TRP and 3-HK were negative predictors of anxiety and stress, but KYN positively predicted anxiety and stress. Moreover, TRP negatively predicted depression, while KYNA/3-HK was a negative predictor of anxiety. The correlation between depression, anxiety, and stress and TKP activation in COVID-19 could provide prospective biomarkers, especially the reduction in TRP and 3HK levels and the increase in KYN. Our results suggest that the alteration of TKP is not only a potential biomarker of viral infection-related long-term psychiatric disorders but also that the therapy targets future viral infections related to depression and anxiety.},

In this systematic review, we examined the relationship between kynurenine pathway metabolites (KYN, kynurenic acid KYNA, tryptophan TRP, quinolinic acid QUIN, KYN/TRP ratio) and depression symptoms in the context of pro-inflammatory activation and immune response. Out of 5,082 articles, fifteen studies were suitable; ten studies (N = 315 medically ill patients treated with interferon-alpha IFN-$\alpha$) reported baseline and post-intervention plasma KYN, TRP and KYN/TRP ratios which were included in quantitative meta-analysis. Data from five studies were summarized (IFN-$\alpha$, interferon-beta IFN-$\beta$, and lipopolysaccharide LPS). We found that IFN-$\alpha$ treatment in patients with chronic illnesses was associated with decreased TRP, increased levels of KYN and KYN/TRP ratio and depression scores from baseline to follow-up at both 4 and 24 weeks. Our findings suggest that increased risk of depression observed after immune-activating agents in patients with chronic medical illnesses is likely mediated by the kynurenine pathway. Further prospective studies are required to investigate the exact pathophysiology of the KYN pathway in depression.},

abstract = {The potential contribution of chronic inflammation to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depression has received increasing attention. Elevated biomarkers of inflammation, including inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins, have been found in depressed patients, and administration of inflammatory stimuli has been associated with the development of depressive symptoms. Data also have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines can interact with multiple pathways known to be involved in the development of depression, including monoamine metabolism, neuroendocrine function, synaptic plasticity, and neurocircuits relevant to mood regulation. Further understanding of mechanisms by which cytokines alter behavior have revealed a host of pharmacologic targets that may be unique to the impact of inflammation on behavior and may be especially relevant to the treatment and prevention of depression in patients with evidence of increased inflammation. Such targets include the inflammatory signaling pathways cyclooxygenase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and nuclear factor-B, as well as the metabolic enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, which breaks down tryptophan into kynurenine. Other targets include the cytokines themselves in addition to chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells from the periphery to the brain. Psychosocial stress, diet, obesity, a leaky gut, and an imbalance between regulatory and pro-inflammatory T cells also contribute to inflammation and may serve as a focus for preventative strategies relevant to both the development of depression and its recurrence. Taken together, identification of mechanisms by which cytokines influence behavior may reveal a panoply of personalized treatment options that target the unique contributions of the immune system to depression. {\textcopyright} 2012 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

As a consequence, H4-biopterin plays a key role in a vast number of biological processes and pathological states associated with neurotransmitter formation, vasorelaxation, and immune response. In mammals, its biosynthesis is controlled by hormones, cytokines and certain immune stimuli. This review aims to summarize recent developments concerning regulation of H4-biopterin biosynthetic and regulatory enzymes and pharmacological effects of H4-biopterin in various conditions, e.g. endothelial dysfunction or apoptosis of neuronal cells. Also, approaches towards gene therapy of diseases like the different forms of phenylketonuria or of Parkinson's disease are reviewed. Additional emphasis is given to H4-biopterin biosynthesis and function in non-mammalian species such as fruit fly, zebra fish, fungi, slime molds, the bacterium Nocardia as well as to the parasitic protozoan genus of Leishmania that is not capable of pteridine biosynthesis but has evolved a sophisticated salvage network for scavenging various pteridine compounds, notably folate and biopterin.},

abstract = {Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) cofactor is essential for various processes, and is present in probably every cell or tissue of higher organisms. BH4 is required for various enzyme activities, and for less defined functions at the cellular level. The pathway for the de novo biosynthesis of BH4 from GTP involves GTP cyclohydrolase 1, 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase. Cofactor regeneration requires pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase and dihydropteridine reductase. Based on gene cloning, recombinant expression, mutagenesis studies, structural analysis of crystals and NMR studies, reaction mechanisms for the biosynthetic and recycling enzymes were proposed. With regard to the regulation of cofactor biosynthesis, the major controlling point is GTP cyclohydrolase I, the expression of which may be under the control of cytokine induction. In the liver at least, activity is inhibited by BH4, but stimulated by phenylalanine through the GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback regulatory protein. The enzymes that depend on BH4 are the phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, the latter two being the rate-limiting enzymes for catecholamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) biosynthesis, all NO synthase isoforms and the glyceryl-ether mono-oxygenase. On a cellular level, BH4 has been found to be a growth or proliferation factor for Crithidia fasciculata, haemopoietic cells and various mammalian cell lines. In the nervous system, BH4 is a self-protecting factor for NO, or a general neuroprotecting factor via the NO synthase pathway, and has neurotransmitter-releasing function. With regard to human disease, BH4 deficiency due to autosomal recessive mutations in all enzymes (except sepiapterin reductase) have been described as a cause of hyperphenylalaninaemia. Furthermore, several neurological diseases, including Dopa-responsive dystonia, but also Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism and depression, have been suggested to be a consequence of restricted cofactor availability.},

In patients with several types of cancer, neopterin concentrations in body fluids like urine, serum/plasma or ascites parallel the course of the disease, and a higher neopterin concentration in patients is an independent predictor of a shorter survival period. Neopterin is released in large amounts from human monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells preferentially following stimulation with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-$\gamma$, thus reflecting the immune activation status. Therefore, not only as a laboratory diagnostic tool, the measurement of neopterin concentrations allows studying the immunological network and its interaction with the pathogenesis of tumor development.

abstract = {Background: For a better understanding of the factors underlying the Post-Acute COVID Syndrome, we studied the relationship between symptoms and functional alterations in COVID-19 patients 10 months after hospitalization. Methods: One-hundred-one patients hospitalized between March 1st and June 30th 2020 participated in a follow-up visit for an assessment of clinical history, comorbidities, lung function, physical capacity and symptoms, including the SGRQ for health-related quality of life, PHQ-9-D for depression, and SOMS-2 J for somatoform disorders. Data were analyzed by univariate comparisons and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: Median age was 60 years, 42% were female, 76% had at least one comorbidity, the median length of the hospital stay was 8 days, 19% had been on the ICU. The most prevalent symptoms included shortness of breath (49%), fatigue (49%) and cognitive impairment (39%). Signs of major depression (PHQ-9-D ≥ 10) occurred in 28%/2% (p < 0.05) of patients with/without self-reported cognitive impairment, with median total SGRQ score being 25.4/5.3 (p < 0.05). There were associations between shortness of breath and BMI, SGRQ and hemoglobin levels; between fatigue, SGRQ and PHQ-9-D; and between cognitive impairment and PHQ-9-D (p < 0.05 each) but not with lung function or physical capacity. Characteristics of the acute disease were not related to symptoms. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that 10 months after discharge from a hospital stay due to COVID-19, the percentages of patients with symptoms were high. Symptoms showed a consistent pattern but could not be attributed to altered lung function or physical capacity. Our results suggest a role for alternative etiologies including psychosocial factors.},

The clinical symptoms of the affected patients are heterogeneous, ranging from mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonitis and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death. Systemic immune over activation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection causes the cytokine storm, which is especially noteworthy in severely ill patients with COVID-19.

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It frequently presents with unremitting fever, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and systemic complications (e.g., gastrointestinal, renal, cardiac, and hepatic involvement), encephalopathy, and thrombotic events. The respiratory symptoms are similar to those accompanying other genetically related beta-coronaviruses (CoVs) such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Hypoxemic respiratory symptoms can rapidly progress to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, leading to multi-organ system dysfunction syndrome. Severe cases are typically associated with aberrant and excessive inflammatory responses. These include significant systemic upregulation of cytokines, chemokines, and pro-inflammatory mediators, associated with increased acute-phase proteins (APPs) production such as hyperferritinemia and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as lymphocytopenia. The neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are high among those with severe and critical illnesses. This review highlights the central nervous system (CNS) complications associated with COVID-19 attributed to primary CNS involvement due to rare direct neuroinvasion and more commonly secondary CNS sequelae due to exuberant systemic innate-mediated hyper-inflammation. It also provides a theoretical integration of clinical and experimental data to elucidate the pathogenesis of these disorders. Specifically, how systemic hyper-inflammation provoked by maladaptive innate immunity may impair neurovascular endothelial function, disrupt BBB, activate CNS innate immune signaling pathways, and induce para-infectious autoimmunity, potentially contributing to the CNS complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Direct viral infection of the brain parenchyma causing encephalitis, possibly with concurrent neurovascular endotheliitis and CNS renin angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation, is also reviewed.},

Low grade inflammation and subsequent changes in neurotransmitter levels could be the pathophysiological link. In the current study we investigated the association of neurotransmitter precursor amino acids with a diagnosis of depression or state anxiety in 154 subjects suffering from breast cancer (BCA+), depression (DPR+), both or neither. Sociodemographic parameters, severity of depressive symptoms, and state anxiety (ANX) were recorded. Neopterin, kynurenine/tryptophan and phenylalanine/tyrosine were analysed by HPLC or ELISA. Significantly higher serum neopterin values were found in DPR+ patients (p=0.034) and in ANX+ subjects (p=0.008), as a marker of Th1-related inflammation. The phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio (index of the catecholamine pathway) was associated with the factors "breast cancer" and "depression" and their interaction (all p<0.001); it was highest in the DPR+BCA+ group. The kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (index of the serotonin pathway) was significantly associated with the factors "breast cancer" and "state anxiety" and their interaction (p<0.001, p=0.026, p=0.02, respectively); it was highest in the ANX+BCA+ group. In BCA+ patients kynurenine/tryptophan ratios correlated with severity of state anxiety (r=0.226, p=0.048, uncorrected) and phenylalanine/tyrosine ratios with severity of depressive symptoms (r=0.376, p<0.05, corrected). In conclusion, levels of neurotransmitter precursor amino acids correlate with mental health, an effect which was much more pronounced in BCA+ patients than in BCA- subjects. Aside from identifying underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, these results could be the basis for future treatment studies: in BCA+ patients with depression the use of serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors might be recommended while in those with predominant anxiety selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might be the treatment of choice.},

abstract = {The immunomodulatory capacity of mental stress is one of the basic concepts of psychoneuroimmunology. The current prospective longitudinal study was designed to evaluate the effect of acute mental stress on neurotransmitter precursor amino acid levels in individuals with depression at 2 time points. Ten physically healthy patients with a diagnosis of major depressive episode and Montgomery–{\AA}sberg Depression Rating Scale scores (MADRAS) ⩾20 points at inclusion were assessed on 2 study days (once with higher MADRAS scores, once with lower MADRAS scores; median 34.5 days apart) and subjected to a standardized acute mental stress test on each study day. Blood was collected at 4 time points: once prior to and at 3 time points (0, 30 minutes, 60 minutes) following mental stress. Neurotransmitter precursor amino acid levels, that is kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) and phenylalanine/tyrosine (PHE/TYR), as well as neopterin and nitrite were analyzed in a total of 80 individual blood samples. Regression and correlation analyses were performed. Regression analyses of PHE/TYR (R2 =.547) and KYN/TRP (R2 =.440) in relation to MADRAS depression severity showed a quadratic curve fit. This was reflected by a negative linear correlation between MADRAS scores and PHE/TYR as well as KYN/TRP in the lower score range (r = −.805, P <.001 and r = −.586, P <.001 respectively) and a positive correlation in the higher MADRAS score range (r =.713, P <.001 and r =.379, P =.016 respectively). No effect of acute mental stress was found. This analysis exemplifies the implications of sampling as well as data distributions on results. The crosstalk of biological mechanisms that orchestrate metabolic and immunological signaling may vary depending on depression severity resulting in non-linear associations that may explain the heterogeneity of results found in the literature.},

abstract = {Acute and chronic mental stress are both linked to somatic and psychiatric morbidity, however, the neurobiological pathways of these associations are still not fully elucidated. Mental stress is known to be immunomodulatory, which is one of the basic concepts of psychoneuroimmunology. In the present study, neurotransmitter precursor amino acid levels and derived biogenic amines were analyzed prior to and at 0, 30 and 60 minutes following an acute mental stress test (with/without chronic mental stress) in 53 healthy subjects. Psychometric measurements of mental stress, depression and anxiety were collected. Kynurenine/tryptophan was influenced by the factor acute mental stress (KYN/TRP increase), no influence of the factor chronic mental stress or any interaction was found. Phenylalanine/tyrosine was influenced by the factor acute mental stress (PHE/TYR increase) as well as by chronic mental stress (PHE/TYR decrease). Interactions were not significant. KYN/TRP correlated with state anxiety values, while PHE/TYR correlated negatively with chronic stress parameters. Kynurenic acid was significantly reduced in the acute and quinolinic acid in the chronic mental stress condition. In conclusion, neurotransmitter precursor amino acid levels and derived biogenic amines are influenced by acute and chronic mental stress. Mechanisms beyond direct immunological responses may be relevant for the modulation of neurotransmitter metabolism such as effects on enzyme function through cofactor availability or stress hormones.},

abstract = {Patients with somatic diseases are more likely to develop depression than physically healthy individuals, and comorbid depression has been shown to incrementally worsen patients´ health. Physical conditions are known to influence neurotransmitter precursor amino acids, changes in which are associated with depressive symptoms. In this prospective study we investigated neurotransmitter precursor amino acids levels in patients with acute and chronic physical disease and evaluated their association with depressive symptoms. 177 subjects with and without chronic medical comorbidity (factor: chronic physical disease) admitted to the trauma and orthopaedic surgery ward for a surgical intervention (factor: acute physical disease) were included in the analysis. Chronic medical comorbidity was scored using Charlson Index and depressive and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, factor: mental health). The effect of covariates was also evaluated. C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) and phenylalanine/tyrosine (PHE/TYR) were analysed by HPLC or ELISA prior to surgery and at discharge. Mixed Model as well as correlation analyses were performed. CRP and neopterin levels were influenced by the factors “acute physical disease” (both p < 0.001) and “chronic physical disease” (p = 0.024, p = 0.001 respectively). PHE/TYR, an index of the catecholamine pathway) was related to the factors “acute physical disease” (p < 0.001) and “mental health-depression” (p = 0.012), while KYN/TRP (an index of the kynurenine pathway affecting also serotonin) was associated with “chronic physical disease” (p = 0.005). No significant effect of “mental health-anxiety” was found. The effect of “mental health-depression” on PHE/TYR was more pronounced in females (gender p = 0.003). Differences in HADS depression values correlated with changes in PHE/TYR and both correlated with CRP values. In conclusion, inflammatory reactions related to acute or chronic physical conditions can influence the availability of neurotransmitter precursor amino acids l and these changes are associated with mental health.},

abstract = {The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population mental health is of global concern. Inflammatory processes are thought to contribute to mental ill-health, but their role in experiences of psychological distress during the pandemic has not been investigated. We tested the hypothesis that elevated inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity plasma C-reactive protein [CRP] and plasma fibrinogen) measured pre-pandemic would be positively predictive of increased depressive symptoms experienced during the pandemic. Data were analysed from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), with 3574 individuals aged >50 for CRP and 3314 for fibrinogen measured in waves 8 (2016/17) or 9 (2018/19). Depressive symptoms were measured with a short version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) pre-pandemic (2016–2019) and during the pandemic (June/July 2020). Participants with higher baseline CRP concentrations had 40% higher odds of developing depressive symptoms during the pandemic (ORadjusted = 1.40, 95% CI 1.12–1.73, p = 0.003) after full adjustment. Fibrinogen concentrations were also associated with depressive symptoms during the pandemic (ORadjusted = 1.23, 95% CI 1.04–1.46, p = 0.019), but this association was no longer significant after controlling for lifestyle factors (smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity). In this large population study, systemic inflammation measured 1–3 years pre-pandemic was associated with greater depressed mood during the early months of the pandemic. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that higher levels of inflammation increase the vulnerability of older people to impaired mental health in the presence of the widespread stress of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {Tetrahydrobipterin (BH4) is a pivotal enzymatic cofactor required for the synthesis of serotonin, dopamine and nitric oxide. BH4 is essential for numerous physiological processes at periphery and central levels, such as vascularization, inflammation, glucose homeostasis, regulation of oxidative stress and neurotransmission. BH4 de novo synthesis involves the sequential activation of three enzymes, the major controlling point being GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1). Complementary salvage and recycling pathways ensure that BH4 levels are tightly kept within a physiological range in the body. Even if the way of transport of BH4 and its ability to enter the brain after peripheral administration is still controversial, data showed increased levels in the brain after BH4 treatment. Available evidence shows that GCH1 expression and BH4 synthesis are stimulated by immunological factors, notably pro-inflammatory cytokines. Once produced, BH4 can act as an anti- inflammatory molecule and scavenger of free radicals protecting against oxidative stress. At the same time, BH4 is prone to autoxidation, leading to the release of superoxide radicals contributing to inflammatory processes, and to the production of BH2, an inactive form of BH4, reducing its bioavailability. Alterations in BH4 levels have been documented in many pathological situations, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and depression, in which increased oxidative stress, inflammation and alterations in monoaminergic function are described. This review aims at providing an update of the knowledge about metabolism and the role of BH4 in brain function, from preclinical to clinical studies, addressing some therapeutic implications.},

Long-COVID is a new term that is used to describe the enduring symptoms of COVID-19 survivors. Huang et al. reported that fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression were the most common complaints in COVID-19 survivors after 6 months of the infection. A recent meta-analysis showed that 80% of COVID-19 survivors have developed at least one long-term symptom and the most common five were fatigue, headache, attention deficit disorder, hair loss, and dyspnea.

abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 causes major disturbances in serum metabolite levels, associated with severity of the immune response. Despite the numerous advantages of urine for biomarker discovery, the potential association between urine metabolites and disease severity has not been investigated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In a proof-of-concept study, we performed quantitative urine metabolomics in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and controls using LC–MS/MS. We assessed whether metabolites alterations were associated with COVID-19, disease severity, and inflammation. The study included 56 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (26 non-critical and 30 critical disease); 16 healthy controls; and 3 controls with proximal tubule dysfunction unrelated to SARS-CoV-2. Metabolomic profiling revealed a major urinary increase of tryptophan metabolites kynurenine (P < 0.001), 3-hydroxykynurenine (P < 0.001) and 3-hydroxyanthranilate (P < 0.001) in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Urine levels of kynurenines were associated with disease severity and systemic inflammation (kynurenine, r 0.43, P = 0.001; 3-hydroxykynurenine, r 0.44, P < 0.001). Increased urinary levels of neutral amino acids and imino acid proline were also common in COVID-19, suggesting specific transport defects. Urine metabolomics identified major alterations in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, consistent with changes in host metabolism during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between increased urinary levels of kynurenines, inflammation and COVID-19 severity supports further evaluation of these easily available biomarkers.},

The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the status of the TRYCAT pathway, including the levels of TRP and kynurenine (KYN) and the activity of IDO, as measured by the ratio of KYN/TRP. Methods: This systematic review searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Sciences and included 14 articles that compared TRP and tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) in COVID-19 patients versus non-COVID-19 controls, as well as severe/critical versus mild/moderate COVID-19. The analysis was done on a total of 1269 people, including 794 COVID-19 patients and 475 controls. Results: The results show a significant (p < 0.0001) increase in the KYN/TRP ratio (standardized mean difference, SMD = 1.099, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.714; 1.484) and KYN (SMD = 1.123, 95% CI: 0.730; 1.516) and significantly lower TRP (SMD = − 1.002, 95%CI: − 1.738; − 0.266) in COVID-19 versus controls. The KYN/TRP ratio (SMD = 0.945, 95%CI: 0.629; 1.262) and KYN (SMD = 0.806, 95%CI: 0.462; 1.149) were also significantly (p < 0.0001) higher and TRP lower (SMD = − 0.909, 95% CI: − 1.569; − 0.249) in severe/critical versus mild/moderate COVID-19. No significant difference was detected in kynurenic acid (KA) and the KA/KYN ratio between COVID-19 patients and controls. Conclusions: Our results indicate increased activity of the IDO enzyme in COVID-19 and severe/critical patients. The TRYCAT pathway is implicated in the pathophysiology and progression of COVID-19 and may signal a worsening outcome of the disease.},

abstract = {The pivotal tryptophan (TRP) metabolite kynurenine is converted to several neuroactive compounds, including kynurenic acid (KYNA), which is elevated in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of people with schizophrenia (SZ) and may contribute to cognitive abnormalities in patients. A small proportion of TRP is metabolized to serotonin and further to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Notably, KP metabolism is readily affected by immune stimulation. Here, we assessed the acute effects of an oral TRP challenge (6 g) on peripheral concentrations of kynurenine, KYNA and 5-HIAA, as well as the cytokines interferon-&gamma;, TNF-&alpha; and interleukin-6, in 22 participants with SZ and 16 healthy controls (HCs) using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. TRP raised the levels of kynurenine, KYNA and 5-HIAA in a time-dependent manner, causing >20-fold, >130-fold and 1.5-fold increases in kynurenine, KYNA and 5-HIAA concentrations, respectively, after 240 min. According to multivariate analyses, neither baseline levels nor the stimulating effects of TRP differed between participants with SZ and HC. Basal cytokine levels did not vary between groups, and remained unaffected by TRP. Although unlikely to be useful diagnostically, measurements of circulating metabolites following an acute TRP challenge may be informative for assessing the in vivo efficacy of drugs that modulate the neosynthesis of KYNA and other products of TRP degradation.},

The alterations in tryptophan metabolism such as changes in the levels of serotonin, kynurenine, and kynurenine acid have been implicated in the etiology of depression for more than 50 years. In recent years, accumulated evidence has revealed that gut microbial communities, besides being essential players in various aspects of host physiology and brain functioning are also implicated in the etiology of depression, particularly through modulation of tryptophan metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the evidence of the role of gut bacteria in disturbed tryptophan metabolism in depression. We summed up the effects of microbiota on serotonin, kynurenine, and indole pathway of tryptophan conversion relevant for understanding the pathogenesis of depressive behavior. Moreover, we reviewed data regarding the therapeutic effects of probiotics, particularly through the regulation of tryptophan metabolites. Taken together, these findings can open new possibilities for further improvement of treatments for depression based on the microbiota-mediated modulation of the tryptophan pathway.},

We aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on whether depression is associated with lowered serotonin concentration or activity in a systematic umbrella review of the principal relevant areas of research. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched using terms appropriate to each area of research, from their inception until December 2020. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large data-set analyses in the following areas were identified: serotonin and serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, concentrations in body fluids; serotonin 5-HT1A receptor binding; serotonin transporter (SERT) levels measured by imaging or at post-mortem; tryptophan depletion studies; SERT gene associations and SERT gene-environment interactions. Studies of depression associated with physical conditions and specific subtypes of depression (e.g. bipolar depression) were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of included studies using the AMSTAR-2, an adapted AMSTAR-2, or the STREGA for a large genetic study. The certainty of study results was assessed using a modified version of the GRADE. We did not synthesise results of individual meta-analyses because they included overlapping studies. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020207203). 17 studies were included: 12 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 1 collaborative meta-analysis, 1 meta-analysis of large cohort studies, 1 systematic review and narrative synthesis, 1 genetic association study and 1 umbrella review. Quality of reviews was variable with some genetic studies of high quality. Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, showed no association with depression (largest n = 1002). One meta-analysis of cohort studies of plasma serotonin showed no relationship with depression, and evidence that lowered serotonin concentration was associated with antidepressant use (n = 1869). Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the 5-HT1A receptor (largest n = 561), and three meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining SERT binding (largest n = 1845) showed weak and inconsistent evidence of reduced binding in some areas, which would be consistent with increased synaptic availability of serotonin in people with depression, if this was the original, causal abnormaly. However, effects of prior antidepressant use were not reliably excluded. One meta-analysis of tryptophan depletion studies found no effect in most healthy volunteers (n = 566), but weak evidence of an effect in those with a family history of depression (n = 75). Another systematic review (n = 342) and a sample of ten subsequent studies (n = 407) found no effect in volunteers. No systematic review of tryptophan depletion studies has been performed since 2007. The two largest and highest quality studies of the SERT gene, one genetic association study (n = 115,257) and one collaborative meta-analysis (n = 43,165), revealed no evidence of an association with depression, or of an interaction between genotype, stress and depression. The main areas of serotonin research provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations. Some evidence was consistent with the possibility that long-term antidepressant use reduces serotonin concentration.},

@article{Meiser2013,
abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) coincides with a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. A key player in the loss of dopaminergic neurons is oxidative stress. Dopamine (DA) metabolism itself is strongly linked to oxidative stress as its degradation generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DA oxidation can lead to endogenous neurotoxins whereas some DA derivatives show antioxidative effects. Therefore, DA metabolism is of special importance for neuronal redox-homeostasis and viability.In this review we highlight different aspects of dopamine metabolism in the context of PD and neurodegeneration. Since most reviews focus only on single aspects of the DA system, we will give a broader overview by looking at DA biosynthesis, sequestration, degradation and oxidation chemistry at the metabolic level, as well as at the transcriptional, translational and posttranslational regulation of all enzymes involved. This is followed by a short overview of cellular models currently used in PD research. Finally, we will address the topic from a medical point of view which directly aims to encounter PD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Meiser et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {An UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the determination of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), their phase I metabolites 5-HIAA, DOPAC and HVA, and their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates in human brain microdialysis samples obtained from two patients with acute brain injuries, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from four patients with obstructive hydrocephalus, and a lumbar CSF sample pooled mainly from patients undergoing spinal anesthesia in preparation for orthopedic surgery. The method was validated by determining the limits of detection and quantification, linearity, repeatability and specificity. The direct method enabled the analysis of the intact phase II metabolites of 5-HT and DA, without hydrolysis of the conjugates. The method also enabled the analysis of the regioisomers of the conjugates, and several intact glucuronide and sulfate conjugates were identified and quantified for the first time in the human brain microdialysis and CSF samples. We were able to show the presence of 5-HIAA sulfate, and that dopamine-3-O-sulfate predominates over dopamine-4-O-sulfate in the human brain. The quantitative results suggest that sulfonation is a more important phase II metabolism pathway than glucuronidation in the human brain.},

abstract = {The levels of two isomers of dopamine sulfate, dopamine-3-O-sulfate (DA3S) and dopamine-4-O-sulfate (DA4S), in human plasma were measured by HPLC-fluorometry. The basal plasma levels of DA3S and DA4S in the early morning were 13.8±1.9 and 3.2±0.5 pmoles/ml, respectively (means±S.E.M.). Oral administrations of dopamine (50 mg/body) and 1-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA, 250 mg/body) increased the plasma levels of these dopamine sulfates almost 100-fold to 1807±266 and 1674±195 pmoles/ml of DA3S, and 466±83 and 321±76 pmoles/ml of DA4S. Intravenous dopamine infusion (5 $\mu$g/kg/min for 30 min) markedly increased the plasma free dopamine concentration, as expected, but increased the levels of DA3S and DA4S only slightly to 110±32 and 25±9 pmoles/ml, respectively. In contrast, intravenous L-DOPA (25 mg/body) resulted in a slight increase of free dopamine followed by marked increases of DA3S and DA4S to 691±219 and 139±40 pmoles/ml, respectively. These data indicate that O-sulfation of dopamine, especially 3-O-sulfation, is the main pathway for metabolism of intravenously and orally administered L-DOPA and orally ingested dopamine. This sulfation is suggested to occur in the gut wall. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of cocaine abuse on peripheral catecholamines. Specifically, we measured the concentration of free dopamine, dopamine sulfate, free norepinephrine, norepinephrine sulfate, free epinephrine and epinephrine sulfate in plasma samples obtained from the blood of a group of patients with cocaine addiction (N = 15). The concentrations of free and sulfoconjugated catecholamines in plasma were measured by a radioenzymatic technique. The results of this study revealed significant (P < 0.0001) elevation in plasma dopamine sulfate (8926 ± 1204 pg/mL) of cocaine addicts upon admission to an in-patient treatment facility when compared with the level of this dopamine metabolite in plasma of control subjects (2356 ± 121 pg/mL). Furthermore, there was a significant (P < 0.0001) relationship between elevation in plasma dopamine sulfate levels and severity of cocaine use among these patients, and in the majority of cases the plasma levels of dopamine sulfate declined appreciably in time with abstinence from cocaine. In contrast, no appreciable difference was observed in the concentrations of either free or sulfate-conjugated norepinephrine and epinephrine in plasma of cocaine addicts as compared with controls. Differences in plasma dopamine sulfate among these patients versus controls may be interpreted as a reflection of activation of extracellular dopamine metabolism associated with chronic cocaine exposure in humans. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Background: Short-term antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been shown previously. The further development remains to be determined. Methods: We prospectively followed 29 coronavirus disease 2019 cases, mean age 44 ± 13.2 years. Except for one participant in whom rheumatoid arthritis existed, all other cases were previously healthy. We determined anti-viral binding antibodies at 2–10 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after disease onset as well as neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against wild type at 6 and 12 months and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants at month 12. Three binding antibody assays were used, targeting the nucleocapsid protein (NCP), the S1 subunit of the spike protein, and the receptor binding domain (RBD). Results: Antibodies to the RBD persisted for 12 months in all cases with increasing concentrations, whereas antibodies to S1 dropped below cut-off point in 7 participants and NCP antibodies were above cut-off point in only 5 subjects at month 12. The NAb against wild type were detected in all but 2 samples at 12 months of follow-up but clearly less frequently when targeting the variants. In 5 participants who were vaccinated against COVID-19 there was a strong increase of antibodies against S1 and RBD as well as an increase of NAb titres against wild type and the variants. Conclusion: There was a persisting antibody response against SARS-CoV‑2 up to 12 months after COVID-19 with declining concentrations except for RBD and a strong increase of all antibody concentrations after vaccination.},

@article{Capuron2011,
abstract = {Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common complaints of elderly persons. Recent data suggest that chronic low-grade inflammation, a fundamental characteristic of aging, plays a role. Effects might rely on the influence of inflammation on the activity of two enzymatic pathways, the indoleamine-2,3- dioxygenase (IDO) and the guanosine-triphosphate-cyclohydrolase-1 (GTP-CH1) pathways, which are involved in the biosynthesis of monoamines. The present study assessed this possibility in 284 healthy elderly subjects drawn from the Three-City cohort. Methods: Assays included the measurement of serum interleukin-6 and C-reactive-protein, as inflammatory markers; tryptophan, kynurenine, and their ratio as index of IDO activity; and neopterin, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and nitrite, as markers of GTP-CH1 activity. In addition, structured assessments of depressive symptomatology, fatigue, and general behavioral/neurovegetative symptoms were performed. Results: As expected, age correlated significantly with concentrations of immune markers and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Increased inflammation was related to reduced tryptophan concentrations and increased kynurenine levels, suggestive of IDO-induced increased tryptophan catabolism. In addition, inflammation was associated with increases in neopterin and nitrite levels and in phenylalanine concentrations at the expense of tyrosine. Interestingly, increased tryptophan catabolism was associated with the depressive symptoms of lassitude, reduced motivation, anorexia, and pessimism. In contrast, variations in markers of GTP-CH1 activity correlated more with neurovegetative symptoms, including sleep disturbance, digestive symptoms, fatigue, sickness, and motor symptoms. Conclusions: These findings show that chronic low-grade inflammation in aging is associated with alterations in enzymatic pathways involved in monoamine metabolism and suggest that these alterations might participate in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in elderly persons. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Neuropsychiatric symptoms like mood changes and depression are common in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders such as infections, autoimmune diseases or cancer. The pathogenesis of these symptoms is still unclear. Pro-inflammatory stimuli interfere not only with the neural circuits and neurotransmitters of the serotonergic, but also with those of the adrenergic system. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma stimulates the biosynthesis of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is cofactor for several aromatic amino acid monooxygenases and thus is strongly involved in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin and the catecholamines dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). In macrophages, interferon-gamma also triggers the high output of reactive oxygen species, which can destroy the oxidation-labile BH4. Recent data suggest that oxidative loss of BH4 in chronic inflammatory conditions can reduce the biosynthesis of catecholamines, which may relate to disturbed adrenergic neurotransmitter pathways in patients.},

abstract = {Objective: To review the literature of the validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Method: A review of the 747 identified papers that used HADS was performed to address the following questions: (I) How are the factor structure, discriminant validity and the internal consistency of HADS? (II) How does HADS perform as a case finder for anxiety disorders and depression? (III) How does HADS agree with other self-rating instruments used to rate anxiety and depression? Results: Most factor analyses demonstrated a two-factor solution in good accordance with the HADS subscales for Anxiety (HADS-A) and Depression (HADS-D), respectively. The correlations between the two subscales varied from .40 to .74 (mean .56). Cronbach's alpha for HADS-A varied from .68 to .93 (mean .83) and for HADS-D from .67 to .90 (mean .82). In most studies an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity was achieved when caseness was defined by a score of 8 or above on both HADS-A and HADS-D. The sensitivity and specificity for both HADS-A and HADS-D of approximately 0.80 were very similar to the sensitivity and specificity achieved by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Correlations between HADS and other commonly used questionnaires were in the range .49 to .83. Conclusions: HADS was found to perform well in assessing the symptom severity and caseness of anxiety disorders and depression in both somatic, psychiatric and primary care patients and in the general population. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The anxiety and depressive subscales are also valid measures of severity of the emotional disorder. It is suggested that the introduction of the scales into general hospital practice would facilitate the large task of detection and management of emotional disorder in patients under investigation and treatment in medical and surgical departments.

abstract = {IntroductionThe term ” robust” was introduced into the statistical literature by Box (1953). By then, robust methods such as trimmed means, had been in sporadic use for well over a century, see for example Anonymous (1821). However, Tukey (1960) was the first person to recognize the extreme sensitivity of some conventional statistical procedures to seemingly minor deviations from the assumptions, and to give an eye-opening example. His example, and his realization that statistical methods optimized for the conventional Gaussian model are unstable under small perturbations were crucial for the subsequent theoretical developments initiated by Huber (1964) and Hampel (1968).In the 1960s robust methods still were considered ” dirty” by most. Therefore, to promote their reception in the statistical community it was crucial to mathematize the approach: one had to prove optimality properties, as was done by Huber's minimax results (1964, 1965, 1968), and to give a formal definition ...},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of clozapine on plasma serotonin, platelet serotonin and monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels in schizophrenic patients and to compare their results with those of unmedicated healthy controls. Groups of 20 outpatients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls matched for age, sex and smoking status were recruited for the study. Psychopathology, neurocognitive functioning, plasma serotonin, platelet serotonin and MAO levels were assessed after 1-week drug free interval, and 8 weeks after initiation of clozapine treatment in an open design. The mean clozapine dose at week 8 was 382.5 ± 96.4 (range: 250-600) mg/day. In the patient group, at baseline, plasma serotonin and platelet MAO levels were significantly lower, and platelet serotonin levels were significantly higher than in controls. After 8 weeks of clozapine treatment, plasma serotonin and platelet MAO levels increased significantly, while a significant decrease in platelet serotonin levels was detected compared with baseline values. Baseline platelet MAO levels explained 22% of the variance in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) and improvement in attention, while baseline platelet serotonin predicted 23% of the variance in the improvement in positive symptoms during clozapine treatment. Our data indicate that clozapine may be reversing or compensating for a pre-existing alteration in serotonergic neurotransmission in schizophrenic patients. The prediction of response to clozapine through peripheral biochemical markers may have important clinical implications if repeated in larger samples. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

@article{Paul-Savoie2011,
abstract = {Objectives: It has been proposed that serotonin dysfunctions underlie the pathophysiology of various mood disorders (including major depressive disorder, MDD) and chronic pain conditions characterized by deficient pain inhibition, such as fibromyalgia (FM). There is reliable data showing that serotonin disturbances are involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. However, in the case of FM, results published so far are less consistent. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study sought to measure plasma serotonin levels in FM patients, MDD patients, and healthy controls (HC). Methods: Twenty-nine FM patients, 17 MDD patients, and 57 HC were recruited who did not differ in terms of age, sex, and the presence or absence of a regular menstrual cycle. Plasma samples were analysed with mass spectrometry. Results: Serotonin levels were decreased in MDD patients, relative to FM patients and HC. Post hoc analyses showed that serotonin levels were decreased in FM patients taking antidepressants, relative to HC, but not in drug-free FM patients. Moreover, serotonin levels were negatively correlated with mood symptoms across groups. Discussion: Our results further confirm that MDD is associated with decreased serotonin levels, but that serotonin levels are not altered in FM per se, and suggest that 5-Hydroxytryptamine is related to mood symptoms in these patient groups. Our results also suggest that the taking of antidepressant is a major confound to consider when studying serotonin functioning in FM. The long-term use of antidepressants in FM may lead to serotonin depletion. Conversely, serotonin depletion may be before the taking of antidepressants in FM.

Plasma serotonin was determined using ELISA. Results: There was no significant association between GI problems and autism severity, but a significant positive correlation was seen between different indicators of sleep disorder and severity of autism. Plasma levels of serotonin were significantly higher in autistic children and a significant negative correlation was observed between plasma levels of serotonin and autism severity (r =-0.39, P = 0.02). Conclusion: Elevated plasma serotonin in autistic children and its negative correlation with disease severity may indicate involvement of the neurotransmitter in the neurophysiologic mechanism of autism.},

abstract = {Introduction: The response of patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) to antidepressant treatments have been shown to be affected by multiple factors, including disease severity and inflammation. Increasing evidence indicates that the kynurenine metabolic pathway is activated by inflammation in MDD patients and plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression. Antidepressant treatments have been reported to affect kynurenine pathway metabolite levels as well. This study investigates differential associations between the antidepressant treatment outcome to escitalopram versus desvenlafaxine with the pre-treatment and post-treatment-changes in serotonin and kynurenine pathway metabolite levels. Methods: The levels of serotonin and of kynurenine pathway metabolites were measured in plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in 161 currently depressed patients with MDD at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment with either escitalopram or desvenlafaxine. Treatment response was defined conventionally by a reduction of at least 50% in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21 item (HAMD-21) total score from baseline; remission was defined by reaching a post-treatment HAMD-21 score ≤7. Results: Response to escitalopram treatment was associated with higher baseline serotonin levels (p = 0.022), lower baseline kynurenine (Kyn)/tryptophan (Trp) ratio (p = 0.008) and lower baseline quinolinic acid (QuinA)/tryptophan (Trp) ratio (p = 0.047), suggesting a lower inflammation state. Greater improvement in depression symptoms as measured by percent change of HAMD-21 score from baseline was also associated with higher baseline serotonin levels (p = 0.033) in escitalopram treatment arm. Furthermore, remitters to escitalopram treatment showed significant increases in the kynurenic acid (KynA)/3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) ratio after treatment (p = 0.015). In contrast, response to desvenlafaxine treatment was not associated with any metabolite analyzed. We also confirmed a previous report that plasma serotonin levels are lower in MDD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.004) and that the kynurenine plasma level is negatively associated with depression symptom severity (p = 0.047). Conclusions: In MDD patients the antidepressant response to escitalopram was positively associated with baseline serotonin levels and inversely associated with activation of the kynurenine pathway. These results appear consistent with previous literature showing that biomarker evidence of inflammation is associated with lower response to antidepressants from the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class. Moreover, increases in the kynurenic acid (KynA)/3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) ratio, which previously has been characterized as a neuroprotective index, were associated with full remission under escitalopram treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that is considered a valuable and promising technique for improving depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the exact mechanism by which rTMS ameliorates depressive symptoms remains to be clarified. Objective: The aim of the present study was to analyzed the changes in metabolites of patients with TRD in the rTMS treatment, especially focusing on the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. Methods: Thirteen participants with TRD were enrolled in a high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS study. Cognitive function, depressive symptoms and the concentration of plasma tryptophan (TRP) metabolites were measured at baseline and at the endpoint of rTMS treatment. Results: rTMS treatment significantly improved depressive symptom scores and some subscales of cognitive dysfunction. The present study has demonstrated that rTMS treatment significantly increased plasma TRP levels and significantly decreased plasma serotonin levels, while plasma KYN and kynurenic acid level as well as KYN/TRP ratio remained unchanged. Conclusions: This is the first metabolomic study of patients with TRD undergoing rTMS treatment. To validate the present results, it is necessary to increase the number of cases including controls, use a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, and measure blood concentration over time in the course of rTMS treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Less than half of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) respond to their first antidepressant trial. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remains poor, and there is no reliable method of predicting treatment response. Methods: Thirty-seven MDD subjects and 41 healthy controls, somatically healthy and medication-free for at least six weeks, were recruited, and plasma serotonin (5-HT) levels were assessed at baseline. Twenty-six of the MDD subjects were then treated in an open-label manner with clinically appropriate doses of sertraline for 8 weeks, after which plasma 5-HT levels were again assessed. Response to treatment was defined as an improvement of 50% or more on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Results: Non-responders to sertraline treatment had significantly lower pre-treatment 5-HT levels compared to both healthy controls and responders (F = 4.4, p = 0.004 and p = 0.036, respectively). There was a significant decrease in 5-HT levels over treatment in all MDD subjects (t = 6.2, p = 0.000003). The decrease was significantly more prominent in responders compared to non-responders (t = 2.1, p = 0.047). There was no significant difference in post-treatment 5-HT levels between responders and non-responders. Limitations: The study had a modest sample size. 5-HT levels in plasma may not reflect 5-HT levels in the brain. Conclusions: The results indicate that SSRI response may be facilitated by adequate baseline plasma 5-HT content and that successful SSRI treatment is associated with greater decreases in circulating 5-HT. Plasma 5-HT content may be a predictor of SSRI treatment outcome. Potential underlying mechanisms are discussed.},

abstract = {Serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] plays an important role in many organs as a peripheral hormone. Most of the body's serotonin is circulating in the bloodstream, transported by blood platelets and is released upon activation. The functions of serotonin are mediated by members of the 7 known mammalian serotonin receptor subtype classes (15 known subtypes), the serotonin transporter (SERT), and by covalent binding of serotonin to different effector proteins. Almost all immune cells express at least one serotonin component. In recent years, a number of immunoregulatory functions have been ascribed to serotonin. In monocytes/macrophages, for example, serotonin modulates cytokine secretion. Serotonin can also suppress the release of tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ and interleukin-1$\beta$ by activating serotonin receptors. Furthermore, neutrophil recruitment and T-cell activation can both be mediated by serotonin. These are only a few of the known immunomodulatory roles of serotonin that we will review here.},

abstract = {Dopamine in the circulation occurs mainly as dopamine sulfate, the sources and physiological significance of which have been obscure. In this study, plasma concentrations of dopamine sulfate were measured after a meal, after fasting for 4 days, and during iv L-DOPA, nitro-prusside, or trimethaphan infusion in volunteers; after dopamine infusion in patients with L-aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase deficiency; in arterial and portal venous plasma of gastrointestinal surgery patients; and in patients with sympathetic neurocirculatory failure. Meal ingestion increased plasma dopamine sulfate by more than 50-fold; however, prolonged fasting decreased plasma dopamine sulfate only slightly. L-DOPA infusion produced much larger increments in dopamine sulfate than in dopamine; the other drugs were without effect. Patients with L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase deficiency had decreased dopamine sulfate levels, and patients with sympathetic neurocirculatory failure had normal levels. Decarboxylase-deficient patients undergoing dopamine infusion had a dopamine sulfate/dopamine ratio about 25 times less than that at baseline in volunteers. Surgery patients had large arterial-portal venous increments in plasma concentrations of dopamine sulfate, so that mesenteric dopamine sulfate production accounted for most of urinary dopamine sulfate excretion, a finding consistent with the localization of the dopamine sulfoconjugating enzyme to gastrointestinal tissues. The results indicate that plasma dopamine sulfate derives mainly from sulfoconjugation of dopamine synthesized from L-DOPA in the gastrointestinal tract. Both dietary and endogenous determinants affect plasma dopamine sulfate. The findings suggest an enzymatic gut-blood barrier for detoxifying exogenous dopamine and delimiting autocrine/paracrine effects of endogenous dopamine generated in a 'third catecholamine system'.},

abstract = {Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) represent an emerging global crisis. However, quantifiable risk factors for PASC and their biological associations are poorly resolved. We executed a deep multi-omic, longitudinal investigation of 309 COVID-19 patients from initial diagnosis to convalescence (2–3 months later), integrated with clinical data and patient-reported symptoms. We resolved four PASC-anticipating risk factors at the time of initial COVID-19 diagnosis: type 2 diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific auto-antibodies. In patients with gastrointestinal PASC, SARS-CoV-2-specific and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited unique dynamics during recovery from COVID-19. Analysis of symptom-associated immunological signatures revealed coordinated immunity polarization into four endotypes, exhibiting divergent acute severity and PASC. We find that immunological associations between PASC factors diminish over time, leading to distinct convalescent immune states. Detectability of most PASC factors at COVID-19 diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early disease measurements for understanding emergent chronic conditions and suggests PASC treatment strategies.},

abstract = {Long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is a clinical syndrome featuring diverse symptoms that can persist for months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The etiologies are unknown but may include persistent inflammation, unresolved tissue damage, or delayed clearance of viral protein or RNA. Attempts to classify subsets of PASC by symptoms alone have been unsuccessful. To molecularly define PASC, we evaluated the serum proteome in longitudinal samples from 55 PASC individuals with symptoms lasting ≥60 days after onset of acute infection and compared this to symptomatically recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals. We identified subsets of PASC with distinct signatures of persistent inflammation. Type II interferon signaling and canonical NF-$\kappa$B signaling (particularly associated with TNF), were the most differentially enriched pathways. These findings help to resolve the heterogeneity of PASC, identify patients with molecular evidence of persistent inflammation, and highlight dominant pathways that may have diagnostic or therapeutic relevance.

One Sentence Summary Serum proteome profiling identifies subsets of long COVID patients with evidence of persistent inflammation including key immune signaling pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention.

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious respiratory virus which is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is increasingly clear that recovered individuals, even those who had mild COVID-19, can suffer from persistent symptoms for many months after infection, a condition referred to as “long COVID”, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, or post COVID-19 condition. However, despite the plethora of research on COVID-19, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of these long-term effects. We have undertaken an integrated analysis of immune responses in blood at a transcriptional, cellular, and serological level at 12, 16, and 24 weeks post-infection (wpi) in 69 patients recovering from mild, moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19 in comparison to healthy uninfected controls. Twenty-one of these patients were referred to a long COVID clinic and > 50% reported ongoing symptoms more than 6 months post-infection. Anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgG responses were largely stable up to 24 wpi and correlated with disease severity. Deep immunophenotyping revealed significant differences in multiple innate (NK cells, LD neutrophils, CXCR3+ monocytes) and adaptive immune populations (T helper, T follicular helper, and regulatory T cells) in convalescent individuals compared to healthy controls, which were most strongly evident at 12 and 16 wpi. RNA sequencing revealed significant perturbations to gene expression in COVID-19 convalescents until at least 6 months post-infection. We also uncovered significant differences in the transcriptome at 24 wpi of convalescents who were referred to a long COVID clinic compared to those who were not. Variation in the rate of recovery from infection at a cellular and transcriptional level may explain the persistence of symptoms associated with long COVID in some individuals.},

One of the most appealing robust methods for principal component analysis uses the Projection-Pursuit principle. Here, one projects the data on a lower-dimensional space such that a robust measure of variance of the projected data will be maximized. The Projection-Pursuit-based method for principal component analysis has recently been introduced in the field of chemometrics, where the number of variables is typically large. In this paper, it is shown that the currently available algorithm for robust Projection-Pursuit PCA performs poor in the presence of many variables. A new algorithm is proposed that is more suitable for the analysis of chemical data. Its performance is studied by means of simulation experiments and illustrated on some real data sets. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To facilitate the interpretability of PCA various sparse methods have been proposed recently. However all these methods might suffer from the influence of outliers present in the data. An algorithm to compute sparse and robust PCA was recently proposed by Croux et al. We compare this method to standard (non-sparse) classical and robust PCA and several other sparse methods. The considered methods are illustrated on a real data example and compared in a simulation experiment.

The bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables, equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in this book also apply to other types of publications: journal papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes, and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices of computing languages include Python, C, C plus plus, SQL, Bash, Stan, JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported. You can also leave out computing, for example, to write a fiction. This book itself is an example of publishing with bookdown and R Markdown, and its source is fully available on GitHub.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse. The closest is perhaps Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2015), which provides an ecosystem of packages that support the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.},

Method RBC from fifteen healthy volunteers (HC) and four patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were separated in seven subpopulations by Percoll density gradient centrifugation.   Results The proportion of old RBC was significantly higher in DM compared to HC. In both groups, in vivo aging was marked by changes in RBC shape and decreased cell volume. RBC nitrite, as marker for NO, was higher in DM and increased in both HC and DM during aging. RBC deformability was lower in DM and significantly decreased in old compared to young RBC in both HC and DM. RBC-NOS Serine1177 phosphorylation, indicating enzyme activation, increased during aging in both HC and DM. Arginase I activity remained unchanged during aging in HC. In DM, arginase I activity was significantly higher in young RBC compared to HC but decreased during aging. In HC, concentration of L-arginine, the substrate of RBC-NOS and arginase I, significantly dropped from young to old RBC. In DM, L-arginine concentration was significantly higher in young RBC compared to HC and significantly decreased during aging. In blood from healthy subjects, RBC-NOS activation was additionally inhibited by N5-(1-iminoethyl)-L-Ornithine dihydrochloride which decreased RBC nitrite, and impaired RBC deformability of all but the oldest RBC subpopulation.   Conclusion This study first-time showed highest RBC-NOS activation and NO production in old RBC, possibly to counteract the negative impact of cell shrinkage on RBC deformability. This was even more pronounced in DM. It is further suggested that highly produced NO only insufficiently affects cell function of old RBC maybe because of isolated RBC-NOS in old RBC thus decreasing NO bioavailability. Thus, increasing NO availability may improve RBC function and may extend cell life span in old RBC.},
