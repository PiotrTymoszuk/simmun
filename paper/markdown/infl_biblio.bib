@article{Meiser2013,
abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) coincides with a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. A key player in the loss of dopaminergic neurons is oxidative stress. Dopamine (DA) metabolism itself is strongly linked to oxidative stress as its degradation generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DA oxidation can lead to endogenous neurotoxins whereas some DA derivatives show antioxidative effects. Therefore, DA metabolism is of special importance for neuronal redox-homeostasis and viability.In this review we highlight different aspects of dopamine metabolism in the context of PD and neurodegeneration. Since most reviews focus only on single aspects of the DA system, we will give a broader overview by looking at DA biosynthesis, sequestration, degradation and oxidation chemistry at the metabolic level, as well as at the transcriptional, translational and posttranslational regulation of all enzymes involved. This is followed by a short overview of cellular models currently used in PD research. Finally, we will address the topic from a medical point of view which directly aims to encounter PD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Meiser et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {An UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the determination of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), their phase I metabolites 5-HIAA, DOPAC and HVA, and their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates in human brain microdialysis samples obtained from two patients with acute brain injuries, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from four patients with obstructive hydrocephalus, and a lumbar CSF sample pooled mainly from patients undergoing spinal anesthesia in preparation for orthopedic surgery. The method was validated by determining the limits of detection and quantification, linearity, repeatability and specificity. The direct method enabled the analysis of the intact phase II metabolites of 5-HT and DA, without hydrolysis of the conjugates. The method also enabled the analysis of the regioisomers of the conjugates, and several intact glucuronide and sulfate conjugates were identified and quantified for the first time in the human brain microdialysis and CSF samples. We were able to show the presence of 5-HIAA sulfate, and that dopamine-3-O-sulfate predominates over dopamine-4-O-sulfate in the human brain. The quantitative results suggest that sulfonation is a more important phase II metabolism pathway than glucuronidation in the human brain.},

abstract = {The levels of two isomers of dopamine sulfate, dopamine-3-O-sulfate (DA3S) and dopamine-4-O-sulfate (DA4S), in human plasma were measured by HPLC-fluorometry. The basal plasma levels of DA3S and DA4S in the early morning were 13.8±1.9 and 3.2±0.5 pmoles/ml, respectively (means±S.E.M.). Oral administrations of dopamine (50 mg/body) and 1-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA, 250 mg/body) increased the plasma levels of these dopamine sulfates almost 100-fold to 1807±266 and 1674±195 pmoles/ml of DA3S, and 466±83 and 321±76 pmoles/ml of DA4S. Intravenous dopamine infusion (5 $\mu$g/kg/min for 30 min) markedly increased the plasma free dopamine concentration, as expected, but increased the levels of DA3S and DA4S only slightly to 110±32 and 25±9 pmoles/ml, respectively. In contrast, intravenous L-DOPA (25 mg/body) resulted in a slight increase of free dopamine followed by marked increases of DA3S and DA4S to 691±219 and 139±40 pmoles/ml, respectively. These data indicate that O-sulfation of dopamine, especially 3-O-sulfation, is the main pathway for metabolism of intravenously and orally administered L-DOPA and orally ingested dopamine. This sulfation is suggested to occur in the gut wall. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

Specifically, we measured the concentration of free dopamine, dopamine sulfate, free norepinephrine, norepinephrine sulfate, free epinephrine and epinephrine sulfate in plasma samples obtained from the blood of a group of patients with cocaine addiction (N = 15). The concentrations of free and sulfoconjugated catecholamines in plasma were measured by a radioenzymatic technique. The results of this study revealed significant (P < 0.0001) elevation in plasma dopamine sulfate (8926 ± 1204 pg/mL) of cocaine addicts upon admission to an in-patient treatment facility when compared with the level of this dopamine metabolite in plasma of control subjects (2356 ± 121 pg/mL). Furthermore, there was a significant (P < 0.0001) relationship between elevation in plasma dopamine sulfate levels and severity of cocaine use among these patients, and in the majority of cases the plasma levels of dopamine sulfate declined appreciably in time with abstinence from cocaine. In contrast, no appreciable difference was observed in the concentrations of either free or sulfate-conjugated norepinephrine and epinephrine in plasma of cocaine addicts as compared with controls. Differences in plasma dopamine sulfate among these patients versus controls may be interpreted as a reflection of activation of extracellular dopamine metabolism associated with chronic cocaine exposure in humans. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Background: Short-term antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been shown previously. The further development remains to be determined. Methods: We prospectively followed 29 coronavirus disease 2019 cases, mean age 44 ± 13.2 years. Except for one participant in whom rheumatoid arthritis existed, all other cases were previously healthy. We determined anti-viral binding antibodies at 2–10 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after disease onset as well as neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against wild type at 6 and 12 months and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants at month 12. Three binding antibody assays were used, targeting the nucleocapsid protein (NCP), the S1 subunit of the spike protein, and the receptor binding domain (RBD). Results: Antibodies to the RBD persisted for 12 months in all cases with increasing concentrations, whereas antibodies to S1 dropped below cut-off point in 7 participants and NCP antibodies were above cut-off point in only 5 subjects at month 12. The NAb against wild type were detected in all but 2 samples at 12 months of follow-up but clearly less frequently when targeting the variants. In 5 participants who were vaccinated against COVID-19 there was a strong increase of antibodies against S1 and RBD as well as an increase of NAb titres against wild type and the variants. Conclusion: There was a persisting antibody response against SARS-CoV‑2 up to 12 months after COVID-19 with declining concentrations except for RBD and a strong increase of all antibody concentrations after vaccination.},

@article{Capuron2011,
abstract = {Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common complaints of elderly persons. Recent data suggest that chronic low-grade inflammation, a fundamental characteristic of aging, plays a role. Effects might rely on the influence of inflammation on the activity of two enzymatic pathways, the indoleamine-2,3- dioxygenase (IDO) and the guanosine-triphosphate-cyclohydrolase-1 (GTP-CH1) pathways, which are involved in the biosynthesis of monoamines. The present study assessed this possibility in 284 healthy elderly subjects drawn from the Three-City cohort. Methods: Assays included the measurement of serum interleukin-6 and C-reactive-protein, as inflammatory markers; tryptophan, kynurenine, and their ratio as index of IDO activity; and neopterin, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and nitrite, as markers of GTP-CH1 activity. In addition, structured assessments of depressive symptomatology, fatigue, and general behavioral/neurovegetative symptoms were performed. Results: As expected, age correlated significantly with concentrations of immune markers and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Increased inflammation was related to reduced tryptophan concentrations and increased kynurenine levels, suggestive of IDO-induced increased tryptophan catabolism. In addition, inflammation was associated with increases in neopterin and nitrite levels and in phenylalanine concentrations at the expense of tyrosine. Interestingly, increased tryptophan catabolism was associated with the depressive symptoms of lassitude, reduced motivation, anorexia, and pessimism. In contrast, variations in markers of GTP-CH1 activity correlated more with neurovegetative symptoms, including sleep disturbance, digestive symptoms, fatigue, sickness, and motor symptoms. Conclusions: These findings show that chronic low-grade inflammation in aging is associated with alterations in enzymatic pathways involved in monoamine metabolism and suggest that these alterations might participate in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in elderly persons. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Neuropsychiatric symptoms like mood changes and depression are common in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders such as infections, autoimmune diseases or cancer. The pathogenesis of these symptoms is still unclear. Pro-inflammatory stimuli interfere not only with the neural circuits and neurotransmitters of the serotonergic, but also with those of the adrenergic system. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma stimulates the biosynthesis of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is cofactor for several aromatic amino acid monooxygenases and thus is strongly involved in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin and the catecholamines dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). In macrophages, interferon-gamma also triggers the high output of reactive oxygen species, which can destroy the oxidation-labile BH4. Recent data suggest that oxidative loss of BH4 in chronic inflammatory conditions can reduce the biosynthesis of catecholamines, which may relate to disturbed adrenergic neurotransmitter pathways in patients.},

abstract = {Objective: To review the literature of the validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Method: A review of the 747 identified papers that used HADS was performed to address the following questions: (I) How are the factor structure, discriminant validity and the internal consistency of HADS? (II) How does HADS perform as a case finder for anxiety disorders and depression? (III) How does HADS agree with other self-rating instruments used to rate anxiety and depression? Results: Most factor analyses demonstrated a two-factor solution in good accordance with the HADS subscales for Anxiety (HADS-A) and Depression (HADS-D), respectively. The correlations between the two subscales varied from .40 to .74 (mean .56). Cronbach's alpha for HADS-A varied from .68 to .93 (mean .83) and for HADS-D from .67 to .90 (mean .82). In most studies an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity was achieved when caseness was defined by a score of 8 or above on both HADS-A and HADS-D. The sensitivity and specificity for both HADS-A and HADS-D of approximately 0.80 were very similar to the sensitivity and specificity achieved by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Correlations between HADS and other commonly used questionnaires were in the range .49 to .83. Conclusions: HADS was found to perform well in assessing the symptom severity and caseness of anxiety disorders and depression in both somatic, psychiatric and primary care patients and in the general population. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {IntroductionThe term ” robust” was introduced into the statistical literature by Box (1953). By then, robust methods such as trimmed means, had been in sporadic use for well over a century, see for example Anonymous (1821). However, Tukey (1960) was the first person to recognize the extreme sensitivity of some conventional statistical procedures to seemingly minor deviations from the assumptions, and to give an eye-opening example. His example, and his realization that statistical methods optimized for the conventional Gaussian model are unstable under small perturbations were crucial for the subsequent theoretical developments initiated by Huber (1964) and Hampel (1968).In the 1960s robust methods still were considered ” dirty” by most. Therefore, to promote their reception in the statistical community it was crucial to mathematize the approach: one had to prove optimality properties, as was done by Huber's minimax results (1964, 1965, 1968), and to give a formal definition ...},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of clozapine on plasma serotonin, platelet serotonin and monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels in schizophrenic patients and to compare their results with those of unmedicated healthy controls. Groups of 20 outpatients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls matched for age, sex and smoking status were recruited for the study. Psychopathology, neurocognitive functioning, plasma serotonin, platelet serotonin and MAO levels were assessed after 1-week drug free interval, and 8 weeks after initiation of clozapine treatment in an open design. The mean clozapine dose at week 8 was 382.5 ± 96.4 (range: 250-600) mg/day. In the patient group, at baseline, plasma serotonin and platelet MAO levels were significantly lower, and platelet serotonin levels were significantly higher than in controls. After 8 weeks of clozapine treatment, plasma serotonin and platelet MAO levels increased significantly, while a significant decrease in platelet serotonin levels was detected compared with baseline values. Baseline platelet MAO levels explained 22% of the variance in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) and improvement in attention, while baseline platelet serotonin predicted 23% of the variance in the improvement in positive symptoms during clozapine treatment. Our data indicate that clozapine may be reversing or compensating for a pre-existing alteration in serotonergic neurotransmission in schizophrenic patients. The prediction of response to clozapine through peripheral biochemical markers may have important clinical implications if repeated in larger samples. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Objectives: It has been proposed that serotonin dysfunctions underlie the pathophysiology of various mood disorders (including major depressive disorder, MDD) and chronic pain conditions characterized by deficient pain inhibition, such as fibromyalgia (FM). There is reliable data showing that serotonin disturbances are involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. However, in the case of FM, results published so far are less consistent. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study sought to measure plasma serotonin levels in FM patients, MDD patients, and healthy controls (HC). Methods: Twenty-nine FM patients, 17 MDD patients, and 57 HC were recruited who did not differ in terms of age, sex, and the presence or absence of a regular menstrual cycle. Plasma samples were analysed with mass spectrometry. Results: Serotonin levels were decreased in MDD patients, relative to FM patients and HC. Post hoc analyses showed that serotonin levels were decreased in FM patients taking antidepressants, relative to HC, but not in drug-free FM patients. Moreover, serotonin levels were negatively correlated with mood symptoms across groups. Discussion: Our results further confirm that MDD is associated with decreased serotonin levels, but that serotonin levels are not altered in FM per se, and suggest that 5-Hydroxytryptamine is related to mood symptoms in these patient groups. Our results also suggest that the taking of antidepressant is a major confound to consider when studying serotonin functioning in FM. The long-term use of antidepressants in FM may lead to serotonin depletion. Conversely, serotonin depletion may be before the taking of antidepressants in FM.

Materials and methods: Thirty-five children with autism and 31 healthy subjects were studied. GI problems, sleep disorders, and severity of disorder were assessed. Plasma serotonin was determined using ELISA. Results: There was no significant association between GI problems and autism severity, but a significant positive correlation was seen between different indicators of sleep disorder and severity of autism. Plasma levels of serotonin were significantly higher in autistic children and a significant negative correlation was observed between plasma levels of serotonin and autism severity (r =-0.39, P = 0.02). Conclusion: Elevated plasma serotonin in autistic children and its negative correlation with disease severity may indicate involvement of the neurotransmitter in the neurophysiologic mechanism of autism.},

abstract = {Introduction: The response of patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) to antidepressant treatments have been shown to be affected by multiple factors, including disease severity and inflammation. Increasing evidence indicates that the kynurenine metabolic pathway is activated by inflammation in MDD patients and plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression. Antidepressant treatments have been reported to affect kynurenine pathway metabolite levels as well. This study investigates differential associations between the antidepressant treatment outcome to escitalopram versus desvenlafaxine with the pre-treatment and post-treatment-changes in serotonin and kynurenine pathway metabolite levels. Methods: The levels of serotonin and of kynurenine pathway metabolites were measured in plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in 161 currently depressed patients with MDD at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment with either escitalopram or desvenlafaxine. Treatment response was defined conventionally by a reduction of at least 50% in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21 item (HAMD-21) total score from baseline; remission was defined by reaching a post-treatment HAMD-21 score ≤7. Results: Response to escitalopram treatment was associated with higher baseline serotonin levels (p = 0.022), lower baseline kynurenine (Kyn)/tryptophan (Trp) ratio (p = 0.008) and lower baseline quinolinic acid (QuinA)/tryptophan (Trp) ratio (p = 0.047), suggesting a lower inflammation state. Greater improvement in depression symptoms as measured by percent change of HAMD-21 score from baseline was also associated with higher baseline serotonin levels (p = 0.033) in escitalopram treatment arm. Furthermore, remitters to escitalopram treatment showed significant increases in the kynurenic acid (KynA)/3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) ratio after treatment (p = 0.015). In contrast, response to desvenlafaxine treatment was not associated with any metabolite analyzed. We also confirmed a previous report that plasma serotonin levels are lower in MDD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.004) and that the kynurenine plasma level is negatively associated with depression symptom severity (p = 0.047). Conclusions: In MDD patients the antidepressant response to escitalopram was positively associated with baseline serotonin levels and inversely associated with activation of the kynurenine pathway. These results appear consistent with previous literature showing that biomarker evidence of inflammation is associated with lower response to antidepressants from the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class. Moreover, increases in the kynurenic acid (KynA)/3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) ratio, which previously has been characterized as a neuroprotective index, were associated with full remission under escitalopram treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that is considered a valuable and promising technique for improving depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the exact mechanism by which rTMS ameliorates depressive symptoms remains to be clarified. Objective: The aim of the present study was to analyzed the changes in metabolites of patients with TRD in the rTMS treatment, especially focusing on the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. Methods: Thirteen participants with TRD were enrolled in a high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS study. Cognitive function, depressive symptoms and the concentration of plasma tryptophan (TRP) metabolites were measured at baseline and at the endpoint of rTMS treatment. Results: rTMS treatment significantly improved depressive symptom scores and some subscales of cognitive dysfunction. The present study has demonstrated that rTMS treatment significantly increased plasma TRP levels and significantly decreased plasma serotonin levels, while plasma KYN and kynurenic acid level as well as KYN/TRP ratio remained unchanged. Conclusions: This is the first metabolomic study of patients with TRD undergoing rTMS treatment. To validate the present results, it is necessary to increase the number of cases including controls, use a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, and measure blood concentration over time in the course of rTMS treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Less than half of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) respond to their first antidepressant trial. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remains poor, and there is no reliable method of predicting treatment response. Methods: Thirty-seven MDD subjects and 41 healthy controls, somatically healthy and medication-free for at least six weeks, were recruited, and plasma serotonin (5-HT) levels were assessed at baseline. Twenty-six of the MDD subjects were then treated in an open-label manner with clinically appropriate doses of sertraline for 8 weeks, after which plasma 5-HT levels were again assessed. Response to treatment was defined as an improvement of 50% or more on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Results: Non-responders to sertraline treatment had significantly lower pre-treatment 5-HT levels compared to both healthy controls and responders (F = 4.4, p = 0.004 and p = 0.036, respectively). There was a significant decrease in 5-HT levels over treatment in all MDD subjects (t = 6.2, p = 0.000003). The decrease was significantly more prominent in responders compared to non-responders (t = 2.1, p = 0.047). There was no significant difference in post-treatment 5-HT levels between responders and non-responders. Limitations: The study had a modest sample size. 5-HT levels in plasma may not reflect 5-HT levels in the brain. Conclusions: The results indicate that SSRI response may be facilitated by adequate baseline plasma 5-HT content and that successful SSRI treatment is associated with greater decreases in circulating 5-HT. Plasma 5-HT content may be a predictor of SSRI treatment outcome. Potential underlying mechanisms are discussed.},

abstract = {Serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] plays an important role in many organs as a peripheral hormone. Most of the body's serotonin is circulating in the bloodstream, transported by blood platelets and is released upon activation. The functions of serotonin are mediated by members of the 7 known mammalian serotonin receptor subtype classes (15 known subtypes), the serotonin transporter (SERT), and by covalent binding of serotonin to different effector proteins. Almost all immune cells express at least one serotonin component. In recent years, a number of immunoregulatory functions have been ascribed to serotonin. In monocytes/macrophages, for example, serotonin modulates cytokine secretion. Serotonin can also suppress the release of tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ and interleukin-1$\beta$ by activating serotonin receptors. Furthermore, neutrophil recruitment and T-cell activation can both be mediated by serotonin. These are only a few of the known immunomodulatory roles of serotonin that we will review here.},

abstract = {Dopamine in the circulation occurs mainly as dopamine sulfate, the sources and physiological significance of which have been obscure. In this study, plasma concentrations of dopamine sulfate were measured after a meal, after fasting for 4 days, and during iv L-DOPA, nitro-prusside, or trimethaphan infusion in volunteers; after dopamine infusion in patients with L-aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase deficiency; in arterial and portal venous plasma of gastrointestinal surgery patients; and in patients with sympathetic neurocirculatory failure. Meal ingestion increased plasma dopamine sulfate by more than 50-fold; however, prolonged fasting decreased plasma dopamine sulfate only slightly. L-DOPA infusion produced much larger increments in dopamine sulfate than in dopamine; the other drugs were without effect. Patients with L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase deficiency had decreased dopamine sulfate levels, and patients with sympathetic neurocirculatory failure had normal levels. Decarboxylase-deficient patients undergoing dopamine infusion had a dopamine sulfate/dopamine ratio about 25 times less than that at baseline in volunteers. Surgery patients had large arterial-portal venous increments in plasma concentrations of dopamine sulfate, so that mesenteric dopamine sulfate production accounted for most of urinary dopamine sulfate excretion, a finding consistent with the localization of the dopamine sulfoconjugating enzyme to gastrointestinal tissues. The results indicate that plasma dopamine sulfate derives mainly from sulfoconjugation of dopamine synthesized from L-DOPA in the gastrointestinal tract. Both dietary and endogenous determinants affect plasma dopamine sulfate. The findings suggest an enzymatic gut-blood barrier for detoxifying exogenous dopamine and delimiting autocrine/paracrine effects of endogenous dopamine generated in a 'third catecholamine system'.},

We executed a deep multi-omic, longitudinal investigation of 309 COVID-19 patients from initial diagnosis to convalescence (2–3 months later), integrated with clinical data and patient-reported symptoms. We resolved four PASC-anticipating risk factors at the time of initial COVID-19 diagnosis: type 2 diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific auto-antibodies. In patients with gastrointestinal PASC, SARS-CoV-2-specific and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited unique dynamics during recovery from COVID-19. Analysis of symptom-associated immunological signatures revealed coordinated immunity polarization into four endotypes, exhibiting divergent acute severity and PASC. We find that immunological associations between PASC factors diminish over time, leading to distinct convalescent immune states.

abstract = {Long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is a clinical syndrome featuring diverse symptoms that can persist for months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The etiologies are unknown but may include persistent inflammation, unresolved tissue damage, or delayed clearance of viral protein or RNA. Attempts to classify subsets of PASC by symptoms alone have been unsuccessful. To molecularly define PASC, we evaluated the serum proteome in longitudinal samples from 55 PASC individuals with symptoms lasting ≥60 days after onset of acute infection and compared this to symptomatically recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals. We identified subsets of PASC with distinct signatures of persistent inflammation. Type II interferon signaling and canonical NF-$\kappa$B signaling (particularly associated with TNF), were the most differentially enriched pathways. These findings help to resolve the heterogeneity of PASC, identify patients with molecular evidence of persistent inflammation, and highlight dominant pathways that may have diagnostic or therapeutic relevance.

One Sentence Summary Serum proteome profiling identifies subsets of long COVID patients with evidence of persistent inflammation including key immune signaling pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention.

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious respiratory virus which is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is increasingly clear that recovered individuals, even those who had mild COVID-19, can suffer from persistent symptoms for many months after infection, a condition referred to as “long COVID”, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, or post COVID-19 condition. However, despite the plethora of research on COVID-19, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of these long-term effects. We have undertaken an integrated analysis of immune responses in blood at a transcriptional, cellular, and serological level at 12, 16, and 24 weeks post-infection (wpi) in 69 patients recovering from mild, moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19 in comparison to healthy uninfected controls. Twenty-one of these patients were referred to a long COVID clinic and > 50% reported ongoing symptoms more than 6 months post-infection. Anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgG responses were largely stable up to 24 wpi and correlated with disease severity. Deep immunophenotyping revealed significant differences in multiple innate (NK cells, LD neutrophils, CXCR3+ monocytes) and adaptive immune populations (T helper, T follicular helper, and regulatory T cells) in convalescent individuals compared to healthy controls, which were most strongly evident at 12 and 16 wpi. RNA sequencing revealed significant perturbations to gene expression in COVID-19 convalescents until at least 6 months post-infection. We also uncovered significant differences in the transcriptome at 24 wpi of convalescents who were referred to a long COVID clinic compared to those who were not. Variation in the rate of recovery from infection at a cellular and transcriptional level may explain the persistence of symptoms associated with long COVID in some individuals.},

One of the most appealing robust methods for principal component analysis uses the Projection-Pursuit principle. Here, one projects the data on a lower-dimensional space such that a robust measure of variance of the projected data will be maximized. The Projection-Pursuit-based method for principal component analysis has recently been introduced in the field of chemometrics, where the number of variables is typically large. In this paper, it is shown that the currently available algorithm for robust Projection-Pursuit PCA performs poor in the presence of many variables. A new algorithm is proposed that is more suitable for the analysis of chemical data. Its performance is studied by means of simulation experiments and illustrated on some real data sets. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To facilitate the interpretability of PCA various sparse methods have been proposed recently. However all these methods might suffer from the influence of outliers present in the data. An algorithm to compute sparse and robust PCA was recently proposed by Croux et al. We compare this method to standard (non-sparse) classical and robust PCA and several other sparse methods. The considered methods are illustrated on a real data example and compared in a simulation experiment. It is shown that the robust sparse method preserves the sparsity and at the same time provides protection against contamination. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

The bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables, equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in this book also apply to other types of publications: journal papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes, and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices of computing languages include Python, C, C plus plus, SQL, Bash, Stan, JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported. You can also leave out computing, for example, to write a fiction. This book itself is an example of publishing with bookdown and R Markdown, and its source is fully available on GitHub.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse. The closest is perhaps Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2015), which provides an ecosystem of packages that support the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.},
